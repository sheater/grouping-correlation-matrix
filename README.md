# PV251 Visualization - Grouping correlation matrix

This is the final project for the PV251 course. In general, it visualizes the grouping correlation matrix, which is basically a set of stacked correlation matrices onto each other, where each such a matrix displays correlation of particular group (value of some qualitative variable).

## Motivation and personal impact

I am a junior researcher at the Brno University of Technology, where my primary focus is on real estate market segmentation. The proper real estate market segmentation lies in dividing the heterogeneous market into smaller, more homogeneous submarkets. This can be utilized, for example, for:
- more accurate real estate property valuation
- assist with stakeholders' or investors' business decisions
- identify distinct groups with special needs or potential growth
- delineate specific supply/demand groups (through revealed preference)
- as a foundation for public administration, planning and zoning

Unfortunately, there is no holy grail, how to do segmentation properly.
